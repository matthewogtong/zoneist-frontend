# zoneist

zoneist is a productivity app set out to inspire focus for accomplishing daily objectives with a clear goal-setting.

## Find Your Zone

It can sometimes be incredibly difficult and frustrating to focus on anything. Finding your ‘Zone’ is much easier said than done. I found that for me personally whether I am studying or working, I like to see my progress in realtime in a gamified goal-setting, even if I know the end output should be satisfactory enough. I crave for that real time progress, that small dopamine hit of seeing where I am with my current goals. In comes zoneist, you’ll be able to create an objective and specify it with details, along with customizing it by choosing unique regions and trinkets.
